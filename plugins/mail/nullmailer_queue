=head1 NAME

nullmailer_queue - monitor for nullmailer's send queue.

=head1 APPLICABLE SYSTEMS

This plugin is applicable to any system running the nullmailer MTA.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

This plugin needs to be able to read the nullmailer queue, so it
will need to run as that user or root.

Additionally, the nullmailer queue directory may vary; in that case you
can specify it with the "queuedir" and "errordir" environment variables.

To add extra warning or critical thresholds set queue_warning,
failed_critical etc.

Example:

  [nullmailer_queue]
  user nullmail
  env.queuedir /var/spool/nullmailer/queue
  env.errordir /var/spool/nullmailer/failed
  env.queue_warning 10

=head1 INTERPRETATION

This plugin will draw a stack of 2: the number of emails in the queue, and
the number of emails that have permanently failed sending. The latter has
a warning attached by default, since those should never happen.
